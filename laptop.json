I am using the provided plug and it is slow.  be prepared to wait.  also the advertisement says it comes WITH Office Mobile App and shows the Microsoft Office Suite icons.  please note that nowhere does it actually say \"Microsoft\"  it says word, excel, power point, note.  It came with WPS Office Suite and Open Office included.  i had to download the Free version of Microsoft Office myself.  Not starting off in the most trustworthy way there.  I do like the color though it was the same as my monitor showed so you see what you are getting.  the USB port does accept a USB 2.0 plug, but have not tried to swap info using it yet.  it is in the middle of updating the apps and downloading the apps i use the most.  I will update this Rating as I get more in tune with the machine.  I will say that out of the box the cradle holds very securely but does not fight you when you try to dock/ undock.  it holds its position without a fuss and the screen appears very clear.
